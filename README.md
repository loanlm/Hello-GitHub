# Hello-GitHub
Testing, Testing 1 2
I am a Virginian, born and bred. I take very much pride in this because I live in the best state of all the states. I’m avidly addicted to the outdoors, hunting and fishing supply my life with a lot of joy. Hiking and swimming are only some of the activities that fill my summers, I am a big home wine maker. My grandfather is my best friend and also my mentor, teaching me everything I need to know about everything there is to know.
My family is pride and joy, we hold each other up in times of need. We also push each other down in times of peril, but we always think of the best for one another. I have two brothers and a twin sister, but I get the privilege of being the baby. I’m going to be the first though out of my large family to graduate college, granting me pampering I’m not normally accustomed too.
I’m in the fermentation sciences degree program here at Appalachian State, with an expected graduation date of spring 2016! I’m hoping this class helps me reach that goal, and also the goal of Virginia winemaker. After school I hope to rejoin Veritas Vineyards and Winery in Afton Virginia, and help them climb to the top as the number one winery in the state of Virginia.
Sic Semper Tyrannis!
